# List Implementations Project

This project implements two types of lists as specified by my variant (12 mod 4 = 0):

1. **Circular Single Linked List**
2. **Array List**

The implementation includes working examples and comprehensive tests to verify correct functionality.

## Requirements
- Node.js v20 or higher
- Modern version of npm

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DavidkJun/mrtpz-lab2.git

   
   Install dependencies:
     
   cd mrtpz-lab2
   npm install
        
## Running Tests
Execute the test suite with:
```bash
npm test
```
## CI Integration
This project includes GitHub Actions CI configured to run tests automatically:

Failed test run: [View failure](https://github.com/DavidkJun/mrtpz-lab2/actions/runs/14092159194)

Successful fixed version: [View fix](https://github.com/DavidkJun/mrtpz-lab2/actions/runs/14092173032)


## ðŸ“š Summary

During this project, I gained valuable knowledge about:

### Unit Testing in Software Development
By implementing tests for different list types, I learned that:
-  **Early Bug Detection**: Tests help identify issues during development phases
-  **Change Tracking**: Tests verify functionality without manual code inspection
-  **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive tests ensure all aspects work correctly

### Key Takeaways
1. Tests are crucial for maintaining code reliability
2. Automated testing saves time in long-term development
3. Good test coverage prevents regression bugs
4. CI/CD pipelines enhance development workflow
